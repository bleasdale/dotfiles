Use at your own risk.
This is my Windows 11 set up.
It works reasonably well, but is a w.i.p.
I frequently use for LaTeX, I'm not happy with my Vimtex - Texlab - Snippets interaction. Needs considerable 'refactoring'.
Yet to merge with my Linux/BSD set up.
Yet to add lazy loading.
Beware, the keymaps need a major overhaul, not sensible at the moment. There are even a few clashes, that is, the same map defined more than once.

## With many thanks to the excellent documentation from neovim, plugin authors and a multitude of other people's configs.
